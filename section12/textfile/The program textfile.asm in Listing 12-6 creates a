The program textfile.asm in Listing 12-6 creates and fills a text file with text.
You can specify the number of lines to be filled in the file, as well as text for
the lines. If you don’t specify text for the file, the program will generate a line
of randomly chosen characters and use that instead. Invoking the program is
done like this:
$./textfile 150 Time for tacos!
This invocation would create a new file (the name of which is fixed in the
program as ‘‘testeroo.txt’’) and write the text ‘‘Time for tacos!’’ to the file 150
times before closing the file. If the file testeroo.txt already exists, it will be
overwritten from the beginning. If you don’t type anything after the line count
number, the program will fill the file with random alphanumeric characters.
If you don’t type an integer as the first argument, textfile will display an error
message. If you only type the program name and press Enter, textfile will
display several lines explaining what it is and how to use it.
